2-D_Kinematics
==============
My first project on GitHub, as well as my first major project with HTML/JS

The goal for this project is to create a model to show my AP Physics students how 2-D Kinematics work. 

The ultimate goal is to produce something that students can use to create different scenarios. 
In other words, I want to give the user the ability to change the initial conditions of the problem while keeping the ball within a reasonable space
