2-D_Kinematics
==============
My first project on GitHub, as well as my first major project with HTML/JS

The goal for this project is to create a model to show Physics students how 2-D Kinematics work. 

The ultimate goal is to produce something that can take user input (initial conditions), and simulate the motion of an object under those initial conditions. 

I would first like to focus on mathematical accuracy, and afterwards I would like to make the interface smooth and easy-to-use.
